As an entrepreneurial Data Scientist, I thrive on designing solutions to challenges within deep learning and neural networks. My passion for seamless product design stems from my background in industrial engineering, while I refined my affinity for business through academia and praxis. Placing my solutions within the larger context of its surroundings to create wholistic impact is my sweet spot. I enjoy collaborating with data scientists and business nerds alike and don't shy away from a healthy debate.

Besides German, my favorite languages are:
